# About
Scratch-ML is a personal project I made, because I was using ML libraries blindly without really understanding what was happening. I decided to rebuild everything from scratch using just NumPy. Each implementation here is me figuring out how these algorithms actually work, rather than just calling model.fit() and hoping for the best.
